Writing wills can be a tedious task. Where should I start from? What should I include?

Nasledime is a web-based application which you can use to write, edit and store your wills under Bulgarian law - all in a simple, free, and easy to understand manner.
You can use it for your own needs, or the needs of a friend, relative, or client.

The ultimate goal of the Nasledime project is to one day be a one stop shop for answering questions and providing tools related to various issues of inheritance.
